# Reqflow
ReqFlow is an AI project management software that uses AI to help users with requirement clarification, architectural design, software design, and requirement breakdown. It also supports exporting to TODO documents for execution by AI programming tools. This software specifically addresses the pain points in the "vibe coding" process.

Casual coding that acts on random ideas, lacking overall planning
Difficult team collaboration, as most vibe coding tools available on the market are basically incapable of supporting collaborative work
A huge gap between AI-generated designs and actual implementationsâ€”comparable to the difference between "seller's showcase" and "buyer's real experience"
Chaotic requirement management, leading to immense maintenance pressure on "spaghetti code" (disorganized, unmaintainable code)
Markdown documents generated by AI are barely readable (literally "not even a dog would read them" in the original colloquial sense)
No trace of work is left behind, which is a real headache
